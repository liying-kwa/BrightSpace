SUTD 10.009 The Digital World: 1D Project

## Abstract
Finding conductive places to study is often a headache for students, especially during the exam period. Our project seeks
to make known the availability of common, good study spaces (ie. SUTD Library) through the use of lights and an application.

## Introduction
This folder contains the script codes for the Kivy GUI, the first motion sensor and the second motion sensor. For demonstration purposes, only Level 3 of the GUI displays a layout for the seats and 2 motion sensors only cater to one seat.

## Usage
Download gui.py and run it on any operating system to show the Kivy application. Download ultrasound_sensor_1.py and ultrasound_sensor.py on an embedded system and connect it to two motion sensors.

You will need a stable Internet connection for both systems to upload to and retrieve data from Firebase accordingly.
